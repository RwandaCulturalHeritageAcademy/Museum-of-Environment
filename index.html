                        <p>The eight planets in the solar system are divided into two groups: the inner planets and the outer planets.</h>The inner planets are those closest to the Sun and include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are relatively small, rocky, and have few or no moons. The outer planets, on the other hand, are much larger and more massive than the inner planets. They include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. But Uranus and Neptune are known as gas giants. They have thick atmospheres, many moons, and are further from the Sun.</p>
                        <p>The moon is a natural satellite of the Earth, meaning it is a celestial body that orbits around our planet. It is the fifth largest moon in the solar system and is believed to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The moon's surface is covered with craters, mountains, valleys, and plains, and it has no atmosphere or magnetic field.</p>
                        <p>An artificial satellite is a human-made object that is placed into orbit around the Earth or another celestial body. Artificial satellites are used for a variety of purposes, including communication, navigation, weather forecasting, and scientific research.</p>

                        <p>The solar system is also home to a number of smaller bodies, such as asteroids and comets. Asteroids are rocky or metallic objects that are smaller than planets, while comets are made up of ice, dust, and rock. These smaller bodies can be found throughout the solar system and can sometimes pose a threat to Earth if they come too close.</p>
                   <h1>Climate on Earth</h1>
                   <p>Heat storage and redistribution: The oceans have a high heat capacity, meaning they can store a large amount of heat energy. This allows them to absorb and redistribute heat around the planet, moderating temperature changes in coastal regions and other areas. Ocean currents, which are driven by differences in temperature and salinity, transport heat from the equator to the poles, helping to regulate global climate patterns.</p>
                   <p>The climate of the tropics is typically characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall, with little variation in temperature throughout the year and distinct wet and dry seasons. Additionally, the warm temperatures and high humidity in tropical regions create conditions that are ideal for the growth of lush rainforests, which are an important component of the Earth's biodiversity.</p>

                   <p>The climate of middle latitudes, also known as temperate climates, is characterized by moderate temperatures, distinct seasonal changes, and moderate precipitation. These climates are located between the polar and tropical regions, roughly between 30 and 60 degrees latitude in both hemispheres. In general, the temperature in middle latitudes varies more widely than in the tropics, with colder winters and warmer summers. Precipitation patterns can also vary, with some regions experiencing consistent rainfall throughout the year while others have more pronounced seasonal changes in precipitation. The vegetation in middle latitudes varies widely depending on factors such as rainfall and soil type, but common ecosystems include deciduous forests, grasslands, and Mediterranean scrublands.</p>

                   <p>The climate of the Earth's polar regions, located near the North and South poles, is characterized by extremely cold temperatures, strong winds, and low precipitation. There are two types of polar climates: the Arctic climate in the northern hemisphere and the Antarctic climate in the southern hemisphere. These regions are covered in ice and snow year-round, with temperatures rarely rising above freezing. In the winter months, the polar regions experience periods of complete darkness, while in the summer months the sun never sets. Due to the extreme conditions, only a few species of plants and animals are able to survive in the polar regions, such as mosses, lichens, polar bears, penguins, and various types of marine mammals. The polar regions play an important role in regulating the Earth's climate, with ice and snow reflecting much of the sun's energy back into space and helping to cool the planet.</p>

        <header>Rwanda profile</header>
        <p>Rwanda is a landlocked country located in East Africa, with a population of over 12 million people. The country has a rich and diverse environment, with a range of ecosystems including rainforests, savannas, and wetlands. In addition to land-based environmental challenges, Rwanda is also vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. The country has taken steps to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, including through the development of renewable energy sources and climate-smart agriculture practices.</p>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Rwanda's landscape has undergone significant changes over the past few decades, particularly due to the country's high population density and agricultural practices. Historically, much of Rwanda was covered in dense rainforests and grasslands, but deforestation and conversion of land for farming have resulted in the loss of much of this natural vegetation. In addition, the high population density has led to the cultivation of steep hillsides and other marginal lands, which has contributed to soil erosion, loss of topsoil, and reduced agricultural productivity.
    To address these challenges, the Rwandan government has implemented a number of programs aimed at reforestation, soil conservation, and sustainable land use practices. These efforts include the planting of millions of trees, terracing of hillsides to reduce erosion, and the promotion of agroforestry practices that combine tree planting with crop production. These efforts have helped to slow the pace of deforestation and erosion, while also improving the livelihoods of rural communities through increased agricultural productivity and income.</p>
        <p>Overall, while Rwanda faces significant environmental challenges, the country has shown a strong commitment to sustainable development and environmental conservation, with notable progress made in reforestation, soil conservation, and climate change adaptation.</p>

        <h1>Non-Renewable Energy</h1>
        <p>Non-renewable energy refers to energy sources that cannot be easily replenished or regenerated, such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and nuclear energy. These sources of energy are finite and will eventually be depleted, and their use can have negative environmental impacts, such as air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of hazardous waste. Despite these drawbacks, non-renewable energy sources continue to play a significant role in meeting the world's energy needs, although efforts are being made to transition to cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy.</p>

        <h1>Waste management</h1>
        <p>Rwanda has implemented several waste management strategies to reduce the amount of waste generated and promote sustainable practices. Some of these strategies include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Segregation and Recycling:</strong> The Rwandan government has implemented a waste segregation system that encourages residents to separate their waste into organic and inorganic materials. The inorganic materials are then recycled, reducing the amount of waste that goes to the landfill. The government has also established recycling centers throughout the country to process the recycled materials.</il>
            <li><strong>Composting:</strong> The Rwandan government has encouraged the use of composting to reduce organic waste. Composting is the process of breaking down organic waste into nutrient-rich soil that can be used in agriculture. The government has set up composting facilities in various parts of the country.</li>  
            <li><strong>Waste-to-Energy:</strong> Rwanda has also invested in waste-to-energy technologies, which convert waste into energy. The Kigali Up project, for instance, includes a waste-to-energy plant that converts waste into electricity. This strategy helps to reduce the amount of waste that goes to the landfill while also producing clean energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Education:</strong> The Rwandan government has placed a strong emphasis on public education to promote sustainable waste management practices. The government has conducted public awareness campaigns, distributed educational materials, and provided training to residents on proper waste management.</li>
            <li><strong>Ban on Single-Use Plastics:</strong> In 2008, Rwanda became one of the first African countries to ban single-use plastics, such as plastic bags and straws. This strategy has been effective in reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainable practices.</li>

        <h1>Geology</h1>
        <p>Rwanda is located in the East African Rift System, a region characterized by volcanic and tectonic activity. The country has a complex geology, with rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Quaternary. The geology of Rwanda is dominated by Precambrian basement rocks, which consist of granites, gneisses, and schists. In the western part of the country, there are volcanic rocks, including basaltic lavas, tuffs, and agglomerates. The region also has several mineral deposits, including tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, which are associated with the granitic rocks. Additionally, there are hot springs and geothermal areas in the western part of the country, indicating the presence of geothermal resources that can be harnessed for energy.</p>

        <h1>Evolution</h1>
        <h2>Animal evolution</h2>
        <p>Animal evolution refers to the process by which living organisms that belong to the animal kingdom have changed over time through successive generations. Evolutionary changes can result from various mechanisms, such as genetic mutations, natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and other factors.</p>
        <p>There have been several different periods of evolution throughout the history of life on Earth. Here are some of the major periods of evolution:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-Cambrian Era (4.6 billion years ago to 541 million years ago):</strong> This period covers most of the Earth's history, and it saw the emergence of the first prokaryotic organisms, followed by the evolution of eukaryotic cells and multicellular life.</li>
                <li><strong>Paleozoic Era (541 million years ago to 252 million years ago):</strong> This era saw the Cambrian explosion, the rapid diversification of animal life, and the emergence of many new body plans and adaptations. The Paleozoic Era also saw the evolution of plants, the colonization of land by vertebrates, and the development of amphibians and reptiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesozoic Era (252 million years ago to 66 million years ago):</strong> The Mesozoic Era saw the evolution of dinosaurs, birds, and many other reptilian and mammalian groups. This era also saw the emergence of flowering plants, which became dominant on land.</li>
                <li><strong>Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to present):</strong> This era saw the diversification of mammals, the emergence of primates, and the evolution of humans. The Cenozoic Era also saw the evolution of birds and the continued diversification of flowering plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Paleogene Period (66 million years ago to 23 million years ago):</strong> This period saw the recovery and diversification of life after the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. Mammals, including primates, underwent significant evolutionary diversification during this period.</li>
                <li><strong>Neogene Period (23 million years ago to 2.6 million years ago):</strong> The Neogene period saw the emergence of many modern groups of mammals, including apes, elephants, and cats. The climate also underwent significant cooling, leading to the evolution of grasslands and the diversification of grazing animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Quaternary Period (2.6 million years ago to present):</strong> The Quaternary period saw the emergence and diversification of hominins, including the evolution of modern humans. It also saw the evolution and extinction of many large mammals, such as mammoths and saber-toothed cats, and the emergence of modern ecosystems.</li>

        <p>Overall, the history of life on Earth has been characterized by a series of evolutionary changes that have resulted in an enormous diversity of organisms and ecological niches.</p>
    <h2>Human evolution</h2>
    <p>Human evolution refers to the evolutionary process by which modern humans (Homo sapiens) and their ancestral hominid species have emerged over time. The evolution of humans is a complex and ongoing process that has taken place over millions of years, and it involves various hominid species and their adaptations to changing environmental conditions. Here are some of the major stages of human evolution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Australopithecus:</strong> This genus includes several species of bipedal hominids that lived between 4.2 and 2.9 million years ago. They had smaller brains than modern humans but were the first hominids to walk upright on two legs.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo habilis:</strong> This species lived about 2.8 million years ago and is believed to have been the first hominid to use stone tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo erectus:</strong> This species lived between 2 million and 100,000 years ago and had a larger brain than earlier hominids. They were the first hominids to leave Africa and colonize other parts of the world.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo neanderthalensis:</strong> This species lived between 400,000 and 40,000 years ago and had a similar brain size to modern humans. They were adapted to living in cold environments and had a robust build.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo sapiens:</strong> This is the species to which modern humans belong. They emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago and spread to other parts of the world, gradually replacing other hominid species. They are characterized by their larger brain size, advanced culture, and complex social organization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, the evolution of humans is a complex and ongoing process that involves the development of various adaptations, including the use of tools, the evolution of larger brains, and the emergence of advanced social behaviors. The study of human evolution helps us understand our origins and how we have become the species that we are today.</p>

It covers an area of 1,122 square kilometers and is named after the Akagera River, which flows through the park. The park is home to a variety of wildlife, including elephants, lions, leopards, giraffes, zebras, and several species of antelope.</p>
<p>The park was established in 1934 to protect the wildlife in the area, but it suffered significant declines in the 1990s due to the Rwandan Civil War and the influx of refugees into the park.

<p>The museum exhibits taxidermied animals found in Akagera National Park for display and further identification of the wildlife. Taxidermy has been practiced for centuries, and it is used for a variety of purposes, including scientific study, hunting trophies, and museum displays. The process of taxidermy typically involves removing the skin from the animal, cleaning and preserving it, and then stuffing it with materials such as cotton or foam. The skin is then mounted on a form or mannequin, and the final result is a lifelike representation of the animal that can be displayed or studied.</p>

        <header>East Africa black mud Turtle</header>
        <p>Pelusios subniger, also known as the black mud turtle, is a species of aquatic turtle found in various parts of Africa, including East Africa, Central Africa, and West Africa. They are small to medium-sized turtles, with adults typically reaching a shell length of 10-15 cm (4-6 inches).</p>
        <p>As their name suggests, black mud turtles have a dark black or brown shell and skin, which helps them blend into the muddy waters where they live. They are primarily aquatic, spending most of their time in slow-moving streams, ponds, and swamps. They are omnivores, feeding on a variety of plant and animal matter, including insects, small fish, and aquatic vegetation.</p>
        <p>Like many species of turtles, black mud turtles are threatened by habitat destruction and over-collection for the pet trade. However, due to their widespread distribution, they are not currently considered to be a conservation concern.</p>
