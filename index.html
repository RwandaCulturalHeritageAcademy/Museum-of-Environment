          <h2 class="text-center">Solar system</h2>
          <p>The solar system is a group of eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
            Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and other celestial bodies that revolve
            around the sun. A planet is a celestial body that orbits the sun, has sufficient
            mass to assume nearly a round shape, illuminated by the light from the sun
            and cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Dwarf planet is a planet that
            has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Among other celestial
            bodies that revolve around the sun include natural satellites (moons)
            asteroids, comets and meteoroids.

              <h3 class="text-center">Earth planet</h3>
              <div class="col-xs-6">
            <p class="letter">Earth planet is a dense ball about 12,750 km across
              and it is the third from the Sun (150 million km ).
              About 71% of its surface is covered by water, the rest
              by land. The landmass of the Earth is distributed by
              the following continents: Africa, America, Antarctica,
              Asia, Europe and Oceania . The planet is orbited by
              one satellite, the Moon. The Earth’s atmosphere is
              primarily Nitrogen (N2), 78.08 %; Oxygen (O2), 20.95
              %; and Argon, 0.93%; with trace amounts of carbon
              dioxide and water vapor.</p>
             <h3>Earth structure</h3>
             <p><b>Earth is made of four main layers</b></p>
             <ul>
              <li><strong>The crust:</strong> is a solid layer of rock on the surface of the
                planet. Land is made of continental crust of 8 km to 70
                thick and made mostly from granite rock. The layer
                beneath the ocean bed is made of oceanic crust of
                about 8 km thick and made mainly from basalt rock.</li>
              <li><strong>Mantle:</strong> a semi-liquid layer of magma or molten
                rock(iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium and aluminium)
                that moves due to convection currents.</li>
              <li><strong>Outer core:</strong> The liquid mainly of Iron, Nickel, Sulphur
                and oxygen. The movement of its metals creates our
                planet's magnetic field.</li>
              <li><strong>Inner core:</strong> It is mainly made of Iron and Nickel. It is
                hot enough to melt but is solid because of the
                pressure pushing down on it. The temperature
                reaches 5,500 °C.</li>
             </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-6">
                <h3>Tectonic plate's movement</h3>
                <p>The earth’s crust is broken into separate pieces called
                 tectonic plates. Each tectonic plate is free-floating and
                 can move independently. Earthquakes and volcanoes
                 are the direct result of the movement of tectonic
                 plates at fault lines (the boundary between tectonic
                 plates). The movement of the plates creates three
                 types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, divergent,
                 and transform.</p>
                 <ul>
                   <li><strong>Convergent boundary (destructive edge):</strong> Plates move
                     into one another.</li>
                   <li><strong>Divergent boundary (constructive edge):</strong> Plates move
                     apart.</li>
                   <li><strong>Transcurrent boundary or transform edge:</strong> Plates
                     move sideways in relation to each other.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>The Congo Nile Ridge, Volcanoes and high mountains
                   found in Rwanda are the results of these tectonic
                   plate movements.</p>
                   <h3>Continental drift</h3>
                   <p>The separation of the earth continents is attributed to
                     the result of tectonic plate movement. Earth's
                     continents are constantly changing, moving and
                     rearranging themselves over millions of years and this
                     change overtime affects climate and life on Earth</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="text-center">Climate and habitat</h3>
            <p>Seen from space, the great habitats of the Earth show 
              themselves in different colors: the dark blue of the oceans 
              predominates, the eternal ice shines white. 
              On the continents, the deserts shimmer in a light brown, the 
              green band around the equator shows the primeval forests of 
              Africa and the Amazon in South America.
              The middle latitudes in the northern as well as southern half 
              of the globe appear in brown as well as green colors - so in 
              Europe and northern Asia as well as North America and in 
              southern Africa and the Philippines.
              From the equator to the two poles of the earth, the climate 
              changes and determines the diversity and design of the 
              habitats of plants, animals and humans.
              This also applies for the forests and savannahs in the tropics, 
              the deserts in the arid regions, different seasons in the midlatudes and for the oceans with their huge habitats of animals 
              and plants.
              Due to the Earth‘s orbit around the energy giving sun and its 
              own rotation, the climate changes from the equator to the two 
              poles in the north and south. 
              In the individual climate zones, certain temperature and 
              humidity conditons prevail, which have led to the development 
              of characteristic communities of plants, animals and humans.
              The different temperatures of the oceans contribute significantly 
              to the climac changes, mainly because they are responsible 
              for many winds that are triggered by different temperatures of 
              the water surfaces.</p>
              <h3 class="text-center">Oceans and Climate</h3>
              <p>71% of the Earth‘s surface is covered by salty seawater, less than only 1% 
                by drinkable freshwater, 2% by ice and snow and only 26% is dry land and 
                thus habitable by humans. In the northern hemisphere, the proportions of 
                land and water are almost equal; in the southern hemisphere, the seas 
                predominate.
                The seas or oceans are the earth‘s air conditioning system. Only the 
                upper two metres of the oceans can store as much heat as the entire 
                atmosphere. Rain is mainly caused by the evaporation of the water above 
                the sea.</p>
                <h3>How do the oceans influence the climate?</h3>
                <p>The importance of the oceans as an energy store is related to their vast 
                  expanse and depths of up to 4,000 metres, which can absorb, store and 
                  release huge amounts of heat. Warming and cooling of water occurs more 
                  slowly than on land mountains and forests like fields. The air masses 
                  coming from the sea have a significant influence on the climate of the 
                  continents: regions near the coast have a balanced climate with mild 
                  winters and moderately warm summers. Humidity and rainfall are high 
                  almost all year round. Further, inland on the continents, the temperature 
                  differences between day and night, between seasons are greater and there 
                  is less rainfall.</p>
                  <h3>Ocean currents</h3>
                  <p>As water temperatures decrease from the equator towards the poles, 
                    currents occur as a result of the energy balance between cold (lowerenergy) and warm (higher-energy) water. Driven by winds, the surface 
                    water of the currents towards the poles becomes colder, denser and 
                    heavier, so that it sinks in the polar regions. Very cold currents at depth 
                    then flow back towards the equator. The current cycle is closed - the cold 
                    water warms up, becomes lighter and rises.</p>
                    <h3>Nutrients of the oceans</h3>
                    <p>Ocean currents not only influence the climate, they also transport nutrients 
                      over great distances. The ocean depths are constantly enriched by dead
                      plants and animals. The cold underwater currents transport these nutrients 
                      to southern regions, where they gradually rise to upper regions and
                      contribute significantly to the abundance of fish catches.
                      In the tropical seas around the equator, however, stable water tends to 
                      occur throughout the year because of constant solar radiation. Although 
                      algae growth is stimulated by solar energy, mixing with cold, nutrientrich water hardly takes place, so that this water suffers more quickly from 
                      overfishing.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center">The deserts-arid climate</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <p class="letter">A climate is described as dry or arid when precipitation cannot permanently 
              compensate for the loss of water through evaporation. Such arid regions 
              are found on all continents of the earth. Deserts, the driest areas on earth, 
              cover one third of the entire continental surface.</p>
            <h3>How do deserts develop? Subtropical west winds</h3>
            <p><i>Most arid areas lie in a strip on either side of the equator - i.e. around the 
              Tropic of Cancer.</i>The trade winds move the air masses that have rained down over the equator both northwards and southwards, warming them increasingly. Over land, they to a hot and very dry climate. under these conditions, plants can hardly or not at all develop and the largest desert regions on earth form, such as the Sahara and the Karahari in Africa or the Australian desert.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <h3>Coastal deserts</h3>
            <p>Along the west coasts in the tropical and subtropical regions of the 
              continents, deserts are formed by the rise of cold water masses that meet 
              hot desire. As a result, cold ground lust is pushed under a warm lust layer, 
              which prevents rain from forming.
              Well-known coastal deserts are the Atacama Desert in Chile and Peru 
              (South America) and the Namibia in southwestern Africa.</p>
            <h3>Landlocked and relief deserts</h3>
            <p>Humid air masses become colder as they rise up steep mountain ranges 
              and rain down. In the rain shadow on the other side of the mountains, the 
              dry and warm downdrafts create so-called relief deserts. Desert areas 
              also develop in the interior of large continents, where hardly any moisture 
              arrives with the air. Examples are the Takla Makan and Gobi deserts in 
              Asia and the deserts in the interior of Australia</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <h3>Not simply sand!</h3>
            <p>Deserts do not always consist of sand. Rock deserts occupy much larger 
              areas worldwide than the well-known sand deserts. The Sahara, for 
              example, is 70 % rocky desert, characterised by boulders and gravel. 
              They are the result of the physical weathering of the bedrock by strongly 
              changing temperatures and the effect of the wind. If the rocks become 
              smaller and smaller as a result, scree and gravel deserts are formed. Sand 
              deserts form as a result of progressive weathering.</p>
            <h3>Hot during the day - cold at night</h3>
            <p>In both sandy and stony deserts, the surface heats up very quickly - at 
              night, on the other hand, the surface cools down quickly - partly because 
              there are no clouds to prevent it from radiating too quickly. This means that 
              temperature differences of up to 40 degrees can be endured.weathering.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Climate of the middle latitudes</h3>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
           <p id="letter">The mid-latitudes are the areas between the Arctic Circle and the Tropic 
            of Cancer in both hemispheres. In the northern hemisphere are countries 
            such as Canada, the USA, Russia and European countries – in the 
            southern hemisphere countries such as Chile, Argentina, southern
            Africa and Australia.Distinctive seasons such as cold winters and warm 
            summers determine the climate. High and low pressure areas, provide 
            changeable weather throughout the year. Life in the mid-latitudes is
            decisively shaped by the seasons. Plants and animals have to survive cold 
            winters and often dry summers.</br>The climatic diversity of this zone has given rise to different habitats: 
            coniferous forests, deciduous and mixed forests, steppes, winter-cold 
            deserts or Mediterranean hardwoods (e.g. olive trees). The cold seas of 
            the mid-latitudes are important as a climatic factor and because of their 
            abundance of fish as a source of food for humans.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <h3>What shapes the mid-latitudes?</h3>
            <h4 id="little-down"><u>The seasons</u></h4>
            <p>Due to the oblique position of the earth‘s axis in relation to its orbit around 
              the sun, both the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined towards 
              the sun for half of the year. The sun‘s rays hit the earth more steeply and 
              with more energy, it gets warm, the days get longer and the nights
              shorter. Due to the flattening of the angle of incidence of the rays in the 
              second half of the year, they become lower in energy: it gets cooler and 
              now the nights are longer than the day. The mid-latitudes know four 
              seasons: Spring, summer, autumn and winter.</p>
              <h4 id="little-down"><u>The West Winds</u></h4>
              <p>In the mid-latitudes, warm air from the tropics meets cold air from the 
                poles. The earth‘s rotation deflects air flowing out from the equator to the 
                east - this is how the westerly winds are formed. In the course of the year, 
                these shift both to the north - then warm subtropical air flows e.g. to Europe 
                - it becomes warm. If it shifts to the south it becomes cold and it is winter. 
                In South Africa in thesouthern hemisphere it is the opposite.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <h4 id="europe">The specificity of Europe</h4>
            <p>Compared to the mid-latitudes of other continents, 
              Europe has some special features: The ocean current 
              flowing north along the west coast (Gulf Stream) 
              carries warm water masses from the subtropics up to 
              the north of Norway, thus warming the entire coast of 
              northern Europe. In the south, the Mediterranean Sea, 
              which is warm all year round, influences the climate of 
              the surrounding countries. The mountain range of the 
              Pyrenees and the Alps, which run across from west to 
              east, protect the north from particularly hot southern 
              winds and the south of Europe from the cold northern 
              winds.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Tropical climate</h3>
          <div class="col-xs-6">
            <p class="letter">Geographically, the tropics are the area between the equator and the 
              tropics. Here you will find both hot and humid climates (Congo) and very 
              dry climates. Because of the year-round sunshine, there is no cool season 
              - so the average temperature remains constant throughout the year.</p>
              <h3>What characterises the tropics</h3>
              <h4 id="europe">The sun</h4>
              <p>Throughout the year, the sun is higher than in the middle and higher 
                latitudes and twice a year it is even vertical – at the zenith. As a result, the
                earth‘s surface warms up faster and more strongly than in the north or 
                south of the globe. Due to the position of the equator in relation to the sun, 
                the length of the day is always 12 hours. In Rwanda, for example, there is 
                only a deviation of about 40 minutes – in Germany of about 4-5 hours.
                In South Africa in thesouthern hemisphere it is the opposite.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-6">
            <h4 id="europe" id="little-down">Persistent low pressure and the trade winds</h4>
            <p>The heat at the equator causes humid air to rise, the air pressure to fall 
              and so a world-wide area of low pressure stretches along the equator. 
              The rising air creates winds that generate a cycle: warm air flowing in from 
              the ground and falling air masses cooling to the north or south: the trade 
              winds. When these winds blow in from the sea, they bring warm, humid air 
              with them, which rains down in the mountains and forests – for example, in 
              Rwanda in the Nyungwe or Birunga Mountains.</p>
            <h4 id="europe">The tropical rain</h4>
            <p>Because the warm, humid air masses cool down very quickly as they rise 
              near the equator, the moisture condenses and clouds form. This is how 
              the typical cloudbursts with large amounts of water occur regularly in the 
              afternoon.
              The tropical belt along the equator is about 5,000km wide. In the inner 
              and always humid tropics, between 1,000 and 1,500 mm of precipitation 
              fall in a year – twelve times as much as in the middle latitudes (e.g. North 
              America or Europe). In these areas are the large rainforest regions such 
              as the primeval forest in Central Africa (Congo) or in South America at 
              the Amazon (Brazil). The closer one approaches the tropics, the more the 
              aridity increases, the transition to a subtropical dry climate such as the 
              savannahs in Mali, Niger and Chad.</p>
          </div>
        </div>    
        <div class="row">
          <h3 class="text-center">Habitats of the tropics</h3>
          <p>In the permanently humid tropical climate near the equator, evergreen rainforests extend 
            across Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. With increasing distance from the equator, 
            the frequency and quantity of rainfall decreases and deciduous tree species increase. 
            Evergreen forests (e.g. Nyungwe) are replaced by rainforests during prolonged drought. 
            Where lack of rain or unfavourable soil conditions prevent forest growth, savannahs develop - 
            tropical grasslands with individual trees and shrubs (Akagera National Park and the expanses 
            in Tanzania).</p>
          <div class="col-xs-6">
            <h3>Equatorial rain forest such as the Nyungwe</h3>
            <p>Permanent moisture and plenty of sunlight enable lush growth and enormous species 
              richness in tropical forests all year round. The diversity of tree species alone is spectacular, 
              with hundreds of species per hectare; in the whole of Central Europe, for example, there 
              are only 40 species. At a height of 30-40 m, a more or less closed canopy forms. Below 
              this, the various shrub and tree species reach different heights depending on the amount of 
              light available. Most tree trunks are straight and slender and have few branches below the 
              crown. The occurrence of flowers and fruits directly on the trunk is widespread, leaves with 
              elongated leaf tips from which the water film drips off are characteristic.</br>Board roots, stift roots and lianas are conspicuous structures of the rainforest and signs of 
              its diversity. The branches of the trees are often densely covered with mosses, ferns, orchids 
              and bromeliads. Hardly any light penetrates through this multi-layered canopy to the ground, 
              so only a few plants grow there.</p>
              <h3>Fauna and Flora</h3>
              <p>This rich and structured forest provides a privileged habitat for many 
                species of insects, spiders, frogs, reptiles and birds, but larger herbivorous 
                animals are rare.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-6">
            <h3>Luxuriant growth on poor soil</h3>
            <p>Although this ecosystem is the richest and most complex on the planet, 
              the rainforest soil is still fragile, thin and poor. The soils are poorly suited 
              for agriculture. Over a very long period of time, climatic conditions have 
              profoundly deteriorated the chemistry of the rocks and the vegetation 
              draws its nutrients by reusing its own decomposed elements. The 
              ecosystem is highly sensitive to human intervention and change.</p>
            <h3>A forest – forests</h3>
            <p>This intertropical forest is not homogeneous according to its geographical 
              location. There are different types of equatorial forests: deep, flooded 
              forests along rivers, swamps, mountains and mangroves on the coast 
              influenced by salt water.</p>
            <h3>The savannah</h3>
            <p>The savannah is a plant formation composed mainly of herbaceous plants 
              more or less scattered with trees or shrubs. The animal and plant diversity 
              of the savannah is much lower than that of the equatorial forest. In Africa, 
              these vast expanses of herbaceous plants provide sufficient food for herds, 
              whereas the much more frugal Brazilian savannah leaves room for very 
              few mammals.animals are rare.</p>
          </div>

        <h3 class="text-center">Australia, a unique continent</h3>
        <p>Australia, the smallest continent on earth, is located in the 
          southern hemisphere. Its landscape is marked by desert and 
          semi-arid regions and dry forests of eucalyptus and acacia.</br>Thanks to its geographical isolation for more than 200 million 
          years, a particular flora and fauna has developed here.
          Australia‘s fauna includes a significant number of animals 
          that only exist on this continent. 83% of mammals, 89% of 
          reptiles and 93% of amphibians are endemic. Outstanding 
          representatives are the kangaroos, platypus, frilled lizard and 
          thorny devil.
          In the south-eastern and south-western parts of the continent, 
          the climate is temperate with hot, dry summers and rainy 
          winters. Here you will find forest and bush landscapes, 
          productive pastures and arable land.</br>This is where most people live and is home to major cities such 
          as Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center">East African Rift Valley</h3>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-6">
              <p>A rift valley is a lowland region that forms where Earth’s tectonic plates
                move apart or rift. Rift valleys are found both on land and at the bottom
                of the ocean, where they are created by the process of seafloor
                spreading. Rift valleys differ from river valleys and glacial valleys in
                that they are created by tectonic activity and not the process of
                erosion.</br>The most well-known rift valley on Earth is probably the so-called
                "Great Rift Valley System" which stretches from the Middle East in the
                north to Mozambique in the south. The area is geologically active, and
                features volcanoes, hot springs, geysers, and frequent earthquakes.
                All of the rift valleys in the “system” are connected, but not part of a
                single unit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-6">
              <p>The Western Rift includes many of the African Great Lakes. The
                Western Rift is one of the most biodiverse regions in Africa, featuring a
                narrow corridor of highland forests, snow-capped mountains,
                savannas, and chains of lakes and wetlands.</br>The fissure in Kenya's Great Rift
                Valley, which opened after strong
                earth movements, is around 15 meters
                deep and three kilometers long. And
                the fissure is only the beginning:
                Researchers believe that a new
                continent is splitting off in the Horn of
                Africa, which in the distant future will
                include the current countries of

              span across the three countries of
              Rwanda, Uganda D R Congo and covers
              3 national parks of Parc National des

              Rwanda and the Mgahinga Gorilla
              National Park (MGNP) in Uganda. The
              massif covers an area of over 8000 sqkm
              and derives its name from the
              Kinyarwanda word ‘ibirunga’ which
              literally means the volcanoes. The
              volcanoes in this chain include

        <div role="region" aria-labelledby="rwanda_profile" id="rwanda_profile">
          <h2 class="text-center">Rwanda profile</h2>
          <p>Landscapes are subject to constant change over the millennia. Climatic changes in particular, but also tectonic events such as the
            sinking of earth plates or the eruption of volcanoes can completely change vegetation forms. In the last centuries of the Holocene,
            however, humans have ushered in a new age: human intervention in nature and its exploitation, e.g. by burning fossil fuels, cutting down
            forests and interfering with natural river systems, as well as mere mass reproduction, are increasingly showing the negative effects on
            the natural foundations of their existence. This period of time up to the present day is now new referred to as the Anthropocene.</br>
            These changes can also be seen very clearly in Rwanda. As in the other regions of Africa, the Great Lakes region also experienced strong
            climatic changes during the Late Holocene (4000 B.C. to the present day), which caused the landscapes to change considerably. Periods
            of drought alternated with heavy rainy seasons. By 2,500 BC, Rwanda's forests had almost disappeared - but a thousand years later,
            thanks to a long wet period, they had recovered. The natural vegetation of Rwanda was largely destroyed or changed by humans. Only in
            island-like areas of the central highlands and in the three nature reserves (Nyungwe, Virunga and the Akagera National Park) does the
            country's original flora still exist.</br>
            The advent of metal processing, the increase in population, the reclamation of swamp valleys into agricultural fields and the increase in
            livestock farming have changed the forests in the last 2000 years, first in the flatter parts of the country in favor of a savannah and
            grassland landscape, and later a severe decimation of the original higher altitude forest areas also began. The large forest area stretching
            from north to south along the rift valley to Lake Kivu has almost disappeared: Remains of it today are the Nyungwe, the Cyamudongo,
            the Mukura and the Gishwati forest.</br>
            Thus, in the first pictures of Rwanda at the end of the 19th century, one sees a very barren, almost exclusively grassy landscape. In the
            last 150 years, the landscape in Rwanda has developed rapidly and in very contrasting ways: On the one hand, agriculture has spread
            over the hills - 85% of Rwanda's land is now cultivated, the slopes were needed as arable land to feed the rapidly increasing population.
            This increased erosion, so that in some parts of the country, such as Ruhango district, the rock became visible. At the same time,
            however, reforestation measures were taken, swamp valleys were cleared of development to protect the water.</br>
            However, construction and sealing of the area continues to increase steadily, human intervention in water systems, the increase in
            pollution due to the lack of sewage treatment plants are increasingly burdening the quality of the lakes and rivers. The hilly landscape
            continues to be exposed to major erosion - agriculture, mineral extraction, road construction and urbanization.</br>
            The newly emerging global climate change is changing the climate in Rwanda too: rains are becoming heavier but shorter in duration, dry
            seasons are getting warmer and longer.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">History of Rwanda Hydrology</h3>
          <p>The history of the drainage system of Rwanda represents that from the miocene period (23.03 to 5.3 million years ago) to the Pliocene period (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago) befor the formation of the rift valley the drainage system flowed towards the northern part of the country. In the middle Pliocene, the formation of central African Rift resulted in the creation of a river system in the area, that resembles the modern picture in structure, but not the direction of drainage. In the Pleistocene (2,6 million years ago), a massive breakdown of the rift shoulder between Bugesera and Kibuye takes place in this phase the Masangano area probably retains its northern drainage, while rivers in the south and in cnetral Rwanda drain into the rift via Kibuye, forming lake Kivu. The rift should at Kibuye rise again by 700-1150m and Rwanda again is drained to the north. During upper Pleistocene, the
            volcanoes in the north of Rwanda rise
            further, interrupting the drainage of
            Lake Kivu to the North inside the rift. In
            Rwanda, the direction of flow of many
            rivers reverses, the modern Mukungwa
            is created and the modern Nyabarongo
            flows from Masangano to the East,
            flooding all of the Bugesera. Finally,
            the Akagera drain into Lake Victoria
            comes into the existence, which leads
            to the modern-day state.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Non-Renewable Energy</h2>
          <h3>Energy and Climate</h3>
          <p>The fundamental climate driver is the sun.</br>
            The energy it radiates drives air currents and
            causes water to evaporate. This results in the
            distribution of wind, clouds and precipitation.
            However, it is not only atmospheric processes or
            the oceans that play a role in climate, but also
            the parameters of the Earth's orbit. These change
            over longer periods of time and thus cause the
            alternation between ice ages and warm periods.
            In addition, there are other climate factors such
            as the distribution of land and sea, the chemical
            composition of the Earth's atmosphere, the
            latitude of an area, its altitude and position in
            relation to the sea, volcanic activity (rarely also
            meteorite impacts) and vegetation.</br>
            In addition, so-called secondary factors also
            determine the earth's climate. These include the
            general atmospheric circulation with the major
            wind systems, ocean currents and the water
            cycle, as well as regional weather phenomena
            such as El Niño and La Niña. These climate
            factors determine which climate zone a country
            or region belongs to. Defined by temperature,
            there are five climate zones in each hemisphere:
            the polar zone, the subpolar zone, the temperate
            zone, the subtropics and the tropics. However,
            the factors are also decisive for regional
            climates. In this respect, the researchers
            distinguish between high-altitude, urban,
            maritime and continental climates.</br>
            The use of energy resources on Earth play an
            important role in climate change.</p>
          <h3>What is Energy</h3>
          <p>Energy is something like a force that can do
            something.</br>
            Expressed vividly, energy is the ability to do
            work, give off heat or radiate light. It is therefore
            necessary if something is to be set in motion,
            accelerated, lifted, heated or illuminated. Energy
            is vital because it is needed for all natural
            processes.</p>
            <p>Energy can be contained in a system in different
              ways. These possibilities are called forms of
              energy. Examples of forms of energy are kinetic
              energy, chemical energy, electrical energy or
              potential energy.
              Different forms of energy can be converted into
              each other, whereby the sum of the amounts of
              energy over the different forms of energy is
              always the same before and after the energy
              conversion.</p>
            <p>This means: energy is not lost - it is only
              transformed - but it remains.</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-6">
                <h4 class="text-center"><b>Types of Energy:</b></h4>
                <p>There are two types of energy, namely:
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Potential energy:</b>is the stored energy or energy
                      of an object in its position. This energy depends
                      essentially on the composition and position of an
                      object.</li>
                    <li><b>Kinetic energy:</b>this is obtained when an object
                      accelerates.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-6">
                <h4 class="text-center"><b>Forms of energy:</b></h4>
                <p>Potential and Kinetic energy exist in various
                  forms: chemical, thermal, electromagnetic,
                  radiations, gravitational, electric, nuclear energy,
                  etc.</br>The transformation or conversion from one form
                  to another is at the baseline for the various
                  energy sources that allow us to perform all
                  mankind activities.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Source of energy</h3>
        <p>The Earth receives from the Sun an
          uninterrupted flow of energy that, as well as
          supplying all vital processes (both vegetal and
          animal), melts the ice and supplies the water
          cycle between the sea and the atmosphere. From
          those subsequent transformations of solar
          energy into various manifestations and stores
          considered as sources of usable energy for
          human.</p>
          <p>Energy sources are divided in two groups:
          Renewable energy and Non-renewable energy</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-6">
              <p>Non-renewable energy is energy from fossil fuels
                (coal, crude oil, natural gas) and uranium, which,
                once used up, no longer grows back and is
                therefore no longer available.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-6">
              <p>Renewable energy is energy extracted from the
                natural flux and it is provided directly or
                indirectly by the sun, wind, hydro, biomass and
                geothermal whose lifetime is beyond our
                existential needs and challenges.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Rwanda energy primary use is dominated by
            biomass, which accounts for 86.3% of the
            total. Rwanda has one of the lowest
            electricity consumption per capita in the
            region, and generation capacity is low. 83.3%
            of Rwandan households use wood for their
            cooking fuel, followed by charcoal (15.2 %), crop
            waste (0.8%), gas or biogas (0.2%) and other 6%.</br>At national level, the use of electricity for
            lighting changed from 11% in 2010/11 to 20% in
            2013/14. Of the 14% of non-biomass primary
            energy, petroleum products account for 11%
            (used mainly in the transport sector) and
            electricity for approximately 3%.</p>
            <h3>Fossil energy</h3>
            <p>Fossil energy is obtained from fuels that
              were formed in geological prehistory
              from decomposition products of dead
              plants and animals. These include
              lignite, hard coal, peat, natural gas and
              petroleum.</p>
              <p>Fossil fuels are based on the carbon
                cycle and thus enable stored (solar)
                energy of past times to be utilised today.
                The technical exploitation of fossil fuels,
                initially almost exclusively coal, has
                enabled continuous economic growth
                since the mid-19th century in Europe
                and North America, and later in Asia.
                In 2005, 81 % of the world's energy
                needs were met from fossil sources.
                The energy content of the fossil fuels
                listed is based on the carbon content.</p>
              <p>When burned with oxygen, energy is
                released in the form of heat and oxides,
                always including carbon dioxide.
                Therefore, the combustion of fossil fuels
                is highly polluting and harmful to the
                climate, both locally and globally</p>

        <h3>Petroleum</h3>
        <p>Crude oil is a lipophilic mixture of substances
          mainly consisting of hydrocarbons (including
          methane) that is embedded in the earth's crust.
          With more than 17,000 components, crude
          petroleum (crude oil) is one of the most complex
          mixtures of organic substances that occur
          naturally on earth. Crude oil is formed by the
          conversion of organic substances such as
          plants and animals (plankton) through pressure
          and heat.</p>
          <p>Separation and conversion processes transform
            crude oil into a variety of intermediate products
            that serve as the basis for the production of
            fuels and as raw materials for industry. The latter
            include above all starting materials for numerous
            products of the chemical industry, such as
            plastics, varnishes, paints and medicines.
            Petroleum is called "black gold" (because of its
            enormous economic importance).</p>
          <p>Vast, underexplored, and now known to be full of
            petroleum resources, the East African Rift
            System is one of the most exciting areas for
            onshore oil and gas investment in the world.
            These region has a great potential, with 6 billion
            barrels of oil discovered in Lake Albert in
            Uganda and 600 million barrels of oil discovered
            on Kenya’s side of Lake Turkana. Exploration is
            ongoing in Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi.
            Rwanda is considering partnering with oil and
            gas companies for the next stage of exploring
            Lake Kivu for more hydrocarbons – beside
            extracting Methane gas.</p>
            <h3>Peat</h3>
            <p>Peat is an organic sediment that is formed in bogs.
              In its dried state, peat is combustible. It forms from
              the accumulation of undecomposed or incompletely
              decomposed plant matter and represents the first
              stage of charring.</p>
              <p>According to a peat master plan developed in
                2012, the peat-to-power potential is estimated at
                around 230 MW of peat generation based on
                estimated reserves of 12.5 million tons (JICA, 2016).
                About 77% of peat reserves are near Akanyaru,
                Nyabarongo rivers and the Rwabusoro Plains.</p>
              <p>However, the negative environmental impacts of
                draining the wetlands are controversial and a costbenefit calculation is rather negative.
                Peat wetlands are very often special ecological
                places that have a distinctive composition of fauna
                and flora species. Various birds, orchids,
                carnivorous plants are typical of peat bogs and
                swamps. Peat extraction or general peat
                disturbance in those habitants sometimes have
                high negative impact on this ecology. In Rwanda,
                the Kamiranzovu swamp in Nyungwe National Park
                is one biggest and most ancient mountain forest
                swamp in central Africa.</p>
              <h3>Nuclear energy</h3>
              <p>Nuclear or atomic energy is produced by nuclear fission in a
                process that involves bombarding a uranium atom with neutrons
                to split it in two. This releases large amounts of heat, which is
                then used to generate electricity.
                </p>
                <p><u><b>Accidents have serious consequences:</b></u></br>The safety systems of nuclear power plants are very high.
                  However, the human element always has some influence.</p>
                
                <p><u><b>Disposal of nuclear waste:</b></u>A major disadvantage is the disposal of nuclear waste. Nuclear
                  waste takes many, many years to lose its radioactivity and danger.</br></p>
                
                <p><u><b>Limited resources:</b></u></br>Unlike other energy options, nuclear energy is not renewable as
                  uranium has to be mined and is not regenerated.</p>
                
                <p><u><b>External dependence:</b></u></br>There is dependence on the outside. Only a few countries have
                  uranium mines. Furthermore, not all countries have nuclear
                  technology.</p>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-xs-6">
                     <h3 class="text-center"><strong>Advantage</strong></h3>
                     <p><strong>1- High energy density:</strong></br>
                      Uranium is the element commonly used in
                      nuclear power plants to generate electricity.
                      This has the ability to store enormous amounts
                      of energy: Just one gram of uranium is
                      equivalent to 18 litres of petrol and one kilo
                      produces about the same energy as 100 tonnes
                      of coal (Castells, 2012).</p>
                      <p><strong>2- Cheaper than fossil fuels</strong></br>
                      
                      Basically, the cost of uranium appears to be
                      much more expensive than oil or petrol, but if
                      we take into account that only small amounts of
                      this element are required to produce significant
                      amounts of energy, eventually the cost
                      becomes even less than that of fossil fuels.</p>

                      <p><strong>3- Availability</strong></br>
                      
                      A nuclear power plant has the quality to work
                      all the time around the clock 365 days a year to
                      supply a city with electricity. This is due to the
                      fact that the refuelling period is annual or 6
                      months, depending on the plant. Other energy
                      rely on a steady supply of fuel (like coal plants)
                      or are intermittent and are limited by climate

                        fossil fuels.</strong></br>
                      
                      The process in the nuclear power plant does
                      not emit GHGs because it does not require
                      fossil fuels. However, the emissions that do
                      occur occur throughout the life cycle of the
                      plant; construction, operation, extraction and
                      milling of uranium and dismantling of the
                      nuclear power plant. (Sovacool, 2008).</p>

                      <p><strong>5- Produces little waste</strong></br>
                      
                      The waste produced by a nuclear power plant is
                      extremely hazardous and harmful to the
                      environment. However, the amount is relatively
                      small compared to other activities and
                      adequate safety measures are applied that can
                      remain isolated from the environment without
                      posing a risk.</p>

                     <h3 class="text-center"><strong>Disadvantage</strong></h3>
                     
                      <p><strong>1 - Uranium is a non-renewable resource.</strong></br>
                      
                      Historical data from many countries show that
                      on average no more than 50-70% of uranium
                      can be mined. Uranium concentrations of less
                      than 0.01% are no longer profitable because a
                      larger amount of rock must be mined and the
                      energy used is greater than what could be
                      produced with biomass. (Dittmar, 2013).</p>

                      <p><strong>2- Negative environmental damage to human</strong></br>
                      
                      life is effective for generations to come.
                      Final disposal is necessary today at least over
                      a historical period of about 500 years. However,
                      it should be noted that the longevity of
                      radioactive elements depends on the particular
                      atom: iodide-131, for example, is very shortlived and has a half-life of 8.02 days. This
                      means that its radiation intensity is halved after
                      8.02 days. The situation is different for
                      caesium-137, which is much more dangerous
                      for the human organism, because this
                      radionuclide has a half-life of 30.17 years.
                      Plutonium-239, on the other hand, only decays
                      by half after 24,110 years. Uranium-238 has a
                      half-life of 4.468 billion years.</p>

                      <p><strong>3 - Cannot replace fossil fuels</strong></br>
                      
                      Nuclear power alone is not an alternative to oil,
                      gas and coal fuels, as 10 thousand nuclear
                      power plants are needed to replace the world's
                      fossil fuel energy needs. In fact, there are only
                      486 in the world.

                      <p><strong>4- Dependent on fossil fuels</strong></br>
                      
                      Countries concerned with nuclear energy are
                      dependent on fossil fuels. The nuclear fuel
                      cycle includes not only the process of
                      generating electricity at the plant, but also
                      encompasses a range of activities from the
                      exploration and use of uranium mines to the
                      decommissioning and shutdown of the nuclear
                      power plant.</p>

                <h3>Wood/Charcoal</h3>
                <p>Urushingo: In ancient Rwanda, the fire was
                  produced with a traditional tool called, ‘urushingo’
                  that consisted of two wood sticks- a hard and a
                  tender stick. The hard stick was rotated and twisted
                  against the soft wood causing friction that
                  ultimately created ignition, further sustained with
                  dry materials like grasses, dry fungi or cow dung
                  for producing fire.</p>
                  <p>Firewood and charcoal consumption was putting
                    pressure on the national environment, as it was
                    increased year by year. In 2009 the consumption
                    picked 3.2 million tones.</p>
                  <p>To rectify this, the Government has developed the
                    public sector forestry programs, licensing for forest
                    harvesting and promoting alternatives to household
                    fuels such as rice and coffee husks, as well as
                    biogas which has been developed together with the
                    ‘One cow per family’ scheme.</p>
                  <p>The projects related to technologies for producing
                    energy saving cooking stoves were also developed
                    countrywide. This project of improved charcoal
                    stoves in urban and peri-urban Kigali uses the
                    power of the Rwandan private commercial sector to
                    increase the production and purchase of fuelefficient charcoal stoves in a sustainable manner.
                    While the plan focuses on Kigali as the largest
                    market with the best potential for significantly
                    reducing charcoal usage in a sustainable,
                    commercial way, it is envisioned that some of the
                    secondary towns likely will be served by the market
                    linkages created by the project.

        <h2 class="text-center">Renewable energy</h2>
        <h3>Methan gas</h3>
        <p>Lake Kivu, with a depth of up to 450 metres, stores huge
          amounts of methan gas.</p>
          <p>In the depths of Lake Kivu, different parts of the earth
            drift apart. As a result, gases such as methane (CH4
            ) and
            carbon dioxide (CO₂ ) escape and accumulate in the lake
            water, just like in active volcanoes. CO₂ is particularly
            dangerous, as it is odorless and deadly in large
            concentrations. The methane gas is kept deep in the lake
            by the water pressure and used by a pumping station to
            generate energy.</p>
          <p>Lake Kivu methane gas is extracted and used for the first
            time in Rwanda by Union chimique de Belge with a gas
            pilot plant at cape Rubona in 1963 to supply the Bralirwa
            brewery.</p>
          <p>The US-based company Contour Global has anchored in
              2018 a 50 by 30 meter production platform in the middle
              of the lake, which currently produces around 25 MW of
              energy.</p>
          
          <p>In the process, the water is sucked out of the depths and
            the gases are extracted. Gas and water separate
            automatically as soon as the pressure drops on the way
            to the surface - methane separates at a depth of 120
            meters, carbon dioxide at 15 meters. The system directs
            CO₂ back into the water and methane through a pipe to
            the shore. There it is burned, the hot air drives a turbine
            to produce electricity.</p>
          
          <p>Contour Global plans to increase capacity to 100 MW in
          the future with three more platforms.
          Lake Kivu holds enough methane gas to provide 700
          megawatts for 55 years and could supply all of Rwanda
          and neighbouring countries with electricity.</p>

          <h3>Biomass</h3>
          <p>When we talk about "energy from biomass" or
            "bioenergy", we are referring to energy production
            from plants or plant residues.</p>
            <p>Rwanda energy primary use is dominated by
              biomass, which accounts for 86.3% of the total.</p>
              <p>There are different types of raw materials that can
                be used bioenergetically:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>agricultural crops cultivated specifically for this
                    purpose, such as maize or rapeseed</li>
                  <li>Fast-growing woody plants</li>
                  <li>Waste and residual materials from agriculture,
                    households and industry (e.g. wood chips from
                    the wood industry, used fat from food
                    production, but also sewage sludge)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><u><strong>How can we use biomass?</strong></u></h3>
                <p>The types of use are correspondingly diverse:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> as biogas (mostly methane) to generate
                    electricity and heat</li>
                  <li> in liquid form as fuel from vegetable oil
                    (biodiesel)</li>
                  <li>solid as pellets or logs, also for heat and
                    power generation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>70% of Rwandan households use wood for their cooking fuel, followed by charcoal (20%), crop
                  waste (0.8%), gas or biogas (0.2%) and other 9%. (in
                  2018)</p>

                  <div class="col-xs-6">
                   <p><b><u>Advantages of biomass:</u></b></br>The use of biomass can thus have many
                    advantages: It offers an alternative to fossil fuels
                    and, when burned, releases only as much climatedamaging carbon dioxide (CO₂ ) as was bound in
                    the plant during its growth.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-xs-6">
                    <p><b><u>Disadvantages of biomass:</u></b></br>Biomass is not available in unlimited quantities -
                      partly because the land available for growing plants
                      for energy use is not available for growing food. In
                      the long term, population growth, rising meat
                      consumption, climate change and also bioenergy
                      will very likely lead to price increases for
                      agricultural commodities.</p>
                      <p>Biomass is considered by far the most inefficient
                        form of renewable energy use, as its efficiency - the
                        amount of energy produced on a given area - is
                        only 0.5 to 1 percent. By comparison, the efficiency
                        of solar modules is about 20 per cent.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Biogas</h3>
                <p>Biogas is obtained naturally through the
                  decomposition of organic waste or renewable raw
                  materials and is therefore not a fossil fuel. In a
                  fermentation process, organic substances are
                  microbiologically degraded in a warm, humid
                  environment and in the absence of air.</p>
                  <p>In a biogas plant, a controlled, biological
                    decomposition process (digestion or fermentation)
                    takes place, which converts the organic biomass
                    mainly into water, carbon dioxide and methane. The
                    methane contained in the water-saturated biogas is
                    about 60 % valuable. The higher the proportion, the
                    more energy-rich the gas.</p>
                  <p>However, methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. If
                    methane, which has a 25 to 30 times stronger heating
                    effect on the climate than CO₂ , escapes into the
                    atmosphere during the operation of a biogas plant,
                    this has negative effects on the environment.</p>
                  <p>Government has put in place an elaborate program
                    for disseminating bio digesters in households,
                    schools and prisons to reduce demand for firewood
                    and charcoal and reducing household pollution since
                    2007 (the National Domestic Biogas Program /NDBP).
                    The government subsidized biogas technologies
                    with a 50% subsidy and local microfinances provided
                    assistance in the program. The One cow by the
                    family is also a program which supported the biogas
                    project in Rwanda.</p>

                    <h3>Solar energy</h3>
                    <p>Solar energy is the energy of solar radiation.</p>
                    <p>In terms of quantity, the largest use of solar energy is to heat
                      the earth so that biological existence in the known forms is
                      possible in the near-surface region, followed by
                      photosynthesis of algae and higher plants.</p>
                    <p>Most organisms, including humans, depend on solar energy 
                      either directly (as herbivores) or indirectly (as carnivores). 
                      Fuel and building materials also come from it. Solar energy is
                      also responsible for creating air pressure differences in the
                      atmosphere that lead to wind. The earth's water cycle is also
                      driven by solar energy.</p>
                    <p>
                      The geographical location of Rwanda endows it with sufficient
                      solar radiation intensity varying between 4.3 and 5.2 kWh
                      /m2/day and peak sun hours of approximately 5 hours per
                      day. The government has developed measures to encourage
                      the use of solar energy in different sectors such as in some
                      administrative offices, schools and hotels.</p>

        <h3>Wind energy</h3>
        <p>Wind energy is one of the most environmentally friendly, cleanest and safest energy resources. It is considered one of the most promising renewable energy sources due to its worldwide availability, low cost and
          level of technological development. Meanwhile, it plays a significant role in the expansion of renewable energy. Internationally, wind power plants can now produce energy more cheaply than fossil fuel power
          plants. Wind energy represents the most economical expansion potential among renewable energy sources. Wind turbines can be used to generate electricity in all climatic zones, at sea and in all land locations
          (coastal, inland, mountainous).
          Being located close to the equator, Rwanda’s inherent resource potential for wind energy is low. Nevertheless, there are some sites with high potentiality that have been identified based on preliminary satellite
          data: Nyamagabe, Ngoma, Kayonza, Rulindo and Nyabihu.</p>
        <h3>Hydropower</h3>
        <p>In a hydropower plant, water is dammed at a high level in
          order to drive a turbine with the falling water, which
          converts this energy into electricity
          The advantages of hydropower plants are manifold: By
          using water as a renewable energy source, fossil fuels are
          conserved, which contributes to climate protection.
          Furthermore, hydropower plants are independent of
          weather and time and can therefore not only produce
          electricity 24 hours a day, but also store it when needed.</p>
          <p>The main disadvantages of hydropower plants are their
            negative impact on the ecology: the construction of
            hydropower plants alters natural rivers and disturbs the
            groundwater balance; it interferes with the habitats of fish
            and aquatic plants.</p>
            <p>Hydropower plants include both domestic and regional
              hydropower plants. Domestic hydropower consists of
              small and medium-size hydropower located in specific
              sites and Ntaruka hydropower is the first to be
              constructed in Rwanda in 1957. Due to Rwanda
              topography and hydrology, there are about 333 potential
              sites for domestic hydropower countrywide. Regional
              hydropower refers to joint hydro resources such as
              Rusizi on the border with DRC and Rusumo Falls on the
              border with Tanzania.</p>
              <p><b><u>Nyabarongo I:</u></b></br> The Nyabarongo River hydropower dam,
                reservoir, surge shaft, tunnel and power house have been

                additional 30% to Rwanda’s installed generation capacity

                  mitigating the perpetual flooding downstream of the
                  Nyabarongo River that has proved to be hazardous in
                  recent years. Nyabarongo – II will be located in Northern

             <h3>Geothermal Energy</h3>
                <p>Geothermal energy refers to thermal energy (heat)
                  stored within the earth. It is therefore also known as
                  geothermal energy. The centre of the Earth has a
                  similar temperature to the surface of the Sun (circa
                  5000-6000 °C). The planet cools down towards the
                  surface. Hot springs and geothermal power plants
                  reach depths where there is a high temperature
                  difference from the Earth's surface and make the
                  heat of the Earth's interior usable for humans.
                  Near-surface geothermal energy refers to the use of
                  geothermal energy up to a depth of approx. 400 m,
                  which can be used directly.</p>
                  <p>
                  Deep geothermal energy is the use of deposits that
                  are tapped at depths greater than 400 m below
                  ground level and can be used as electricity after
                  conversion by a geothermal power plant.
                  A geothermal power plant does not emit carbon
                  dioxide during electricity production. For this
                  reason alone, this type of energy generation is
                  environmentally friendly.</p>
                  <p>
                  The geothermal processes in the earth's interior run
                  permanently, so electricity generation can be
                  described as regenerative. However, the boreholes
                  can be problematic, as they reach over kilometres
                  into the depths and can trigger earth tremors such
                  as faults.</p>
                  <p>
                  Rwanda has geothermal potential, which is
                  manifested in the form of hot springs. Some
                  prospect areas have been identified for potential
                  exploration: Kinigi, Kalisimbi, Rubavu and
                  Bugarama.</p>
                  <p>
                  However, the impacts on the environment in the
                  Virunga region have not yet been properly
                  researched - for example, on the population of
                  gorillas.</p>
                  <h3>Hydrogen</h3>
                  <p>Hydrogen is a chemical element and, with a share
                    of around 75 percent, a large part of the mass of
                    our solar system consists of this gas. It is part of
                    almost every organic compound on earth and is
                    traded by many experts as the raw material of the
                    future. As an energy storage device, it can be
                    obtained from renewable energies, for example,
                    and used in almost all energy-consuming areas -
                    i.e. mobility, heat and electricity.</p>
                    <p>
                    Compared to fossil fuels, but also to some
                    renewable energies, hydrogen offers many
                    advantages. With the help of hydrogen, excess
                    electrical energy from solar or wind power plants 
                    can be stored well for times when the sun is not 
                    shining and the wind is not blowing. Tied to gas, 
                    electricity from renewable energies is also
                    transportable in this way and can be used
                    anywhere with a time delay.</p>
                    <p>
                    Another advantage of hydrogen is that when it 
                    "burns", that is, when it reacts with oxygen, 
                    predominantly water is produced. This results in 
                    fewer CO₂ emissions and fewer fossil fuels being 
                    used
                    Another possibility for producing hydrogen is 
                    electrolysis with the help of electricity. For 
                    example, electricity from solar or wind power 
                    plants is used to split water into hydrogen and 
                    oxygen. In this way, the electricity can be stored 
                    effectively and for a long time
                    Alternatives to the reforming process and 
                    electrolysis are fermentation of biomass, e.g. 
                    extraction from green algae. An example of this is 
                    Lake Victoria, which is suffering from a massive 
                    glut of algae. The gasification of biomass, i.e. the 
                    addition of oxygen, is the most cost-effective way 
                    of producing hydrogen to date</p>

                  <h3>Environental pollution</h3>
                  <p>Pollution is generally understood to be the
                    contamination of the environment by the
                    action and presence of humans.</br> This
                    includes
                    Water pollution, air pollution and soil
                    pollution (see also contaminated sites and
                    soil degradation) as well as pollution of
                    land areas and water bodies through waste
                    but also noise and, in the world's major
                    cities, light pollution.</br>
                    However, environmental pollution must be
                    distinguished from direct environmental
                    destruction and other types of
                    environmental pollution, such as through
                    raw material extraction, landscape
                    consumption (as building land, etc.) or
                    excessive use by agriculture with
                    fertilisers.
                    Here, a permanent destruction of
                    the ecological balance so important for
                    humans can take place.</p>
                    <p>
                    The large industrialised nations, especially 
                    in the northern hemisphere, consume most 
                    of the world's resources and are largely 
                    responsible for environmental pollution. 
                    In the poorest countries of the world, living 
                    conditions for people are deteriorating 
                    dramatically. Not only do they have to cope 
                    with the direct effects of global warming, 
                    they also lack the financial means to adapt 
                    to the changing climate conditions. 
                    A resident of the northern industrialised
                    nations today consumes an average of 25 
                    tonnes of raw materials and other material 
                    resources per year, while an African 
                    manages with less than 3 tonnes annually.</p>

                    <h3>Greenhouse gas</h3>
                    <h4>Global warming</h4>
                    <p>Greenhouse gases are those gases in the
                      atmosphere that influence the energy balance of the
                      earth. They thus cause the so-called greenhouse
                      effect.</p>
                      <p><u><b>What is a greenhouse effect?</b></u></br>Explained schematically, the earth's surface is
                        heated by solar radiation. The earth's surface
                        reflects the incident radiation as long-wave thermal
                        radiation, which is partially absorbed by the
                        atmospheric greenhouse gases. By subsequently
                        releasing the absorbed energy, part of the radiation
                        is radiated back to the earth and the earth's surface
                        and lower atmospheric layer are warmed. This
                        overall process is called the greenhouse effect.</p>
                      
                        <p><u><b>The human-made greenhouse effect</b></u></br>However, the natural balance between radiation in
                          and radiation out is disturbed by man-made
                          greenhouse gases. Since the beginning of
                          industrialization, emissions of climate-affecting
                          gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane and
                          nitrous oxide have risen dramatically Today, 40%
                          more CO₂ is measured than at the beginning of the
                          industrial age. As a result, the earth's surface has
                          warmed globally by 0.85°C since the beginning of
                          the 20th century</p>
                          <p>However, the combustion of fossil fuels directly
                            releases large amounts of carbon that have been
                            bound in fossil fuels for millions of years as carbon
                            dioxide (CO₂) into the atmosphere, thus increasing
                            the natural greenhouse effect of the atmosphere.</p>

                            <p><u><b>Effect of the greenhouse effect:</b></u></br>The current weather system in the different parts of
                              the world may change massively. An increase in

                                troposphere causes an increase in the air pressure
                                gradient and thus in the wind currents.</p>

                                  frequency. Due to the accumulation of extreme
                                  weather events, tropical regions will experience
                                  increased heavy rainfall and associated massive

                              is almost 400 million tonnes. And far too
                              much of it ends up in the sea.</br>About 75 per cent of all marine litter
                              consists of plastics. According to the
                              United Nations Environment Programme
                              (UNEP), there are now up to 18,000 pieces
                              of plastic of various sizes floating on every
                              square kilometre of ocean surface. Every
                              year, about 8 million tonnes of plastic end
                              up in the sea. Plastic does not dissolve on
                              its own, but is mechanically broken down
                              by wave action and crushed into
                              microplastic under the stress of UV
                              radiation. This slowly sinks to the seabed.
                              Most of the plastic (up to 99 per cent) is 
                              below the surface of the sea.</p>
                              <p>This makes it impossible to estimate the 
                                actual amount of waste.</p>

                             <p>Most plastic enters the sea and ocean via 
                              Asia's longest rivers, the Yangtze and 
                              Yellow Rivers in China and Pakistan's 
                              second largest river, the Indus.</p>
                              
                            <p>The ocean has become one of the dirtiest 
                              places in the world. Plastic bags, plastic 
                              bottles, straws and toothbrushes are 
                              floating in five large rubbish patches. If we 
                              do nothing about it, by 2050 there will be 
                              more plastic swimming in the sea than fish.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Mitigation against environmental degradation</h2>
          <h3>Waste management</h3>
          <p>All materials drawn out of the environment end up as
            waste either directly (from the production sector) or
            indirectly (from the recycling sector). The modern
            principles of waste management are based on the
            assumption that all consumption waste flows back to
            the recycling sector either for recycling and/or for
            disposal.</p>
            <p>The following are main principals of waste
              management:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>A Polluter pays:</b> The party responsible for producing
                waste (pollution) pays for the damage done to the
                environment.</li>
              <li><b>B Resource Efficiency:</b>Using the Earth's limited
                resources in a sustainable manner while minimizing
                environmental impact.</li>
              <li><b>C Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):</b>A policy
                approach under which producers are given a
                significant responsibility – financial and/or physical –
                for the treatment or disposal of post-consumer
                products (waste)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Life cycle of a product: The product life cycle
              illustrates a process in which raw materials are turned
              into products and consumed. Once their useful life
              expires, they are discarded as waste. Thereafter waste
              can be reused, recycled or disposed of.
              </p>
              <p>The waste management hierarchy makes preventing waste a top priority. However, when waste is produced,
                priority is given to preparing it for re-use, then recycling and then recovery. The least desirable option is waste
                disposal.</p>
              
            <h4 class="text-center"><strong>Waste disposal options</strong></h4>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-6">
                <p><b>A - Open dumping:</b>Still in practice in many
                  countries, dumping of waste in open spaces is
                  the worst disposal option. It consumes lots of
                  lands, pollutes the air with greenhouse gases
                  and contaminates the groundwater.</p>
                <p><b>B - Waste to energy:</b>The process turns the nonrecyclable waste into secure energy. It is an
                  alternative to landfills as the trash is used to
                  provide electricity, heat or biogas.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-6">
                <p><b>C - Sanitary landfills:</b>waste is buried either
                  underground or in large piles and sealed in with
                  impermeable synthetic botton liners to prevent
                  groundwater pollution. The landfill is organized
                  in compacted layers, the layers alternate
                  between waste and soil. This alternation of
                  materials reduces odors and allows for more
                  rapid decomposition, which is the breakdown of
                  materials. When a landfill is full, it is sealed and
                  covered in a thick layer of soil or clay. Once the
                  landfill has been evaluated and considered safe,
                  it can be converted into a park or open space for
                  human use.

            <h3>Green Policy in Rwanda</h3>
            <p>The climate variations observed in Rwanda come to
              add to the major socio-ecological disruptions taking
              place, such as deforestation, desertification,
              overuse of land and natural resources. The
              dependency on natural resources in Rwanda makes
              economic activities directly dependent on climate
              conditions. However, the population growth rate act
              as drivers of environmental pressures as it tends to
              grow beyond the ecosystem’s carrying capacity</p>
              <p>Adaptation to climate change effects is of high
                priority for Rwanda ‘due to its vulnerability to the
                impacts of climate change including but not limited
                to flooding, landslide, erosion, and drought which
                cause great damages and losses of human lives.</p>
             <p>In 2011, Rwanda adopted a Green Growth and
              Climate Resilience Strategy to become a developed,
              climate-resilient and low-carbon economy by 2050.
              To achieve this goal, the government and its
              stakeholders are working to reduce emissions and
              foster climate resilience. Rwanda adopted the new
              policy called “Environment and climate change”
              and the law to implement it. It is in this umbrella on
              13th August 2018, Rwanda adopted the new law on
              environment repealing and complementing the
              Organic Law N° 04/2005 of 08/04/2005 determining
              the modalities of protection, conservation, and
              promotion of the environment.</p> 
              <p>The policy goal is for “Rwanda to have a clean and
                healthy environment resilient to climate variability
                and change that supports a high quality of life for its
                society.</p>  
            <p>The seven objectives of the policy are:</p>
            <p>
              (1) Greening economic transformation</br>(2) Enhancing functional natural ecosystems and
              managing biosafety,</br>(3) Strengthening meteorological and early warning
              services</br>(4) Promoting climate change adaptation, mitigation
              and response</br>(5) Improving environmental well-being for
              Rwandans</br>(6) Strengthening environment and climate change
              governance</br>(7) Promoting green foreign and domestic direct
              investment and other capita in flows.
            </p>
            <h3>Prohibition of plastic items and single-use plastics</h3>
            <p>The government of Rwanda wants to
              protect the environment and the health
              of the people from throwaway plastics
              that is why it was adopted the policy
              imposing restrictions on plastic bags
              and single-use plastic items such as
              straws, soda and water bottles, plastic
              cutlery, and almost all food packaging.</p>
              <p>Some scientific reports blame plastic to
                be the cause of flooding and low
                agricultural productivity because this
                can prevent rainwater from penetrating
                into the soil. Moreover, tiny bits of
                plastic are in drinking water, the air we
                breathe, and often enter the food chain
                and could expose us to harmful
                chemicals when we ingest them.</p>
            <p>For this reason, in 2008 the law relating
              to the prohibition of manufacturing,
              importation, use and sale of polythene
              bags in Rwanda was adopted. In
              addition, in 2019, the law relating to the
              prohibition, manufacturing,
              importation, use and sale of plastic
              carry bags and single-use plastic items
              was adopted. However, for exceptional
              cases where the prohibited items may
              be required, the law provides for the
              possibility to apply for special
              authorization, in accordance with the
              guidelines issued by the institution in
              charge of environmental protection.</p>
              <p>According to this law, manufacturers or
                retailers, for example, are required to
                put mechanisms in place to collect and
                segregate used plastics for recycling.</p>

            <h3>Urbanization</h3>
            <p>Until the beginning of the 20th century, Rwanda
              was a country characterized by small to very small
              scattered settlements, which were located in the
              immediate vicinity of agriculturally used areas or
              larger cattle pastures. If you now take a look from
              1900 to today, you can see the unbelievably fast
              and profound change that has taken place within
              these 120 years - especially since the beginning of
              the 21st century. This is also visible in the speed at
              which the country is urbanising.</p>  

            <p>In addition, there has been enormous population
              growth: Between 1960 and 2020, the population of
              Rwanda rose from just under 3 million to over 13
              million. The average age in Rwanda has also
              increased by 1.65 years from 2012 to 2020, from
              18.05 to 19.70. Life expectancy has increased from
              62 to 69 years in the last 10 years.</br>
              Approximately 17% of the population lives in the
              country's larger cities. This growing trend of
              urbanization is increasing at an annual rate of
              3.2%.</p>  

            <p>All of this has concrete implications and poses
              ever greater challenges for the country's
              urbanisation.</p>

           <h3>Green City</h3>
           <p>Cities are often engines of economic growth and
            social advancement, but rapid urbanization in
            most of the developing world has also resulted in
            stark inequalities between the rich and the poor.
            These challenges can only be resolved with
            integrated solutions that address the three
            dimensions of sustainable development, namely
            economic, social and environmental.</p>
            <p>The Green City Kigali Policy has the vision that
              green housing must be for all, especially for the
              poor. It will provide much-needed homes for lowto middle-income inhabitants. One of the project
              objectives is to design well-accepted, low-carbon
              footprint and efficient housing types for various
              sites and density conditions respecting the
              expectations of different social groups.</p>
             <p>An international design competition was
              launched on 18 November 2019. A highly
              renowned jury consisting of leading experts from
              the world of architecture, urban planning and
              environment will then judge the submitted work
              and choose the winning design for an innovative
              and green Urban Master Plan for Kinyinya Hill in
              Kigali.
              <p>Wetlands in Kigali have been threatened by
              human activities mainly conversion human
              settlements, commercial and industrial
              activities decreasing the flood and pollution
              abatement capacity of wetlands but the
              implementation of urban plans promised to
              help them recover.
              </p>
              <p>Urban wetlands absorb excess rainfall, which
              reduces flooding in cities and prevents
              disasters and their subsequent costs. The
              abundant vegetation in urban wetlands, acts as
              a filter for domestic and industrial waste and
              this contributes to improving water quality.
              Urban wetlands supply cities with water and
              are green spaces for recreation which helps to
              promote human wellbeing.</p>

              <p>Today in Rwanda the Nyandungu Wetland EcoPark in Kigali Cityis completed and open for
              visitors. This new Eco-Park project responds to
              the Green Economy in the EDPRS II and one of
              the aspirations of the Vision 2050 of
              developing green cities.

           <h3>Wetland</h3>  
           <p>Rwanda has nearly 280,000 hectares of
            wetlands, almost 11% of the country’s
            total area. These wetlands provide
            critical habitats for wildlife and
            biodiversity, maintain important
            hydrologic processes that help to clean
            and protect ground and surface water,
            support a variety of local livelihoods
            and largely define Rwanda’s idyllic
            undulating topography. Despite their
            ecological and economic importance,
            Rwanda’s wetlands are being degraded
            and lost faster than any other
            ecosystem, with projections
            suggesting a continued and increasing
            rate of loss due to climate change,
            competition for resources, and land
            use conversions.</p> 

            <p>Currently, over half of Rwanda’s
              wetlands are being used for
              agricultural use or energy production. Rugezi wetland, one of the important
              wetlands in Rwanda, is a high altitude
              swamp located in an inundated valley
              in the north of Rwanda, to the east of
              Lake Burera on the Uganda border. Rugezi Swamp, 6745 hectares in size,
              stores immense amounts of CO2 in its
              peat layer, which can be up to 15
              metres deep.</p>

            <p>Erosion, the planting of exotic tree
              species, and the utilization of land for
              agriculture are seriously endangering
              this unique area in northern Rwanda. Plants need CO2 to live; when they die,
            the greenhouse gas is stored in the soil
            and is thus initially removed from the
            climate cycle. When peatlands are
            drained or peat is burned, this CO2,
            some of which is thousands of years
            old, is additionally released into the
            atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Protecting and revitalizing peatlands
              today will contribute to climate
              protection in many ways, helping to
              better manage the impacts of climate
              change that are already real today</p>

            <p>Moreover, wetlands drainage has an
              impact on nature by modifying the
              hydrological functioning of the
              wetland, which leads to the
              disappearance of related flora and/or
              fauna. Drainage also affects the
              downstream water regime. A drained
              wetland evacuates water more quickly
              and thus loses its natural waterregulating power during heavy rains.

          <h3 class="text-center"><strong>What can you do?</strong></h3>
          <p>In Rwanda, the protection of the environment has meant changing the perspectives
            behind waste management. The responsibility to protect the environment through waste
            management has been presented as an individual and collective effort. The successful
            protection of the environmental collectively involves citizens, waste collection
            companies, manufacturers, and the national government. Excess rubbish in Rwanda is
            produced from households, farming fields, companies, hotels, factories, and hospitals
            and disposed in landfills.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Geology</h3>
          <p>Rwanda is located in the East African Rift System, a region characterized by volcanic and tectonic activity. The country has a complex geology, with rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Quaternary. The geology of Rwanda is dominated by Precambrian basement rocks, which consist of granites, gneisses, and schists. In the western part of the country, there are volcanic rocks, including basaltic lavas, tuffs, and agglomerates. The region also has several mineral deposits, including tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, which are associated with the granitic rocks. Additionally, there are hot springs and geothermal areas in the western part of the country, indicating the presence of geothermal resources that can be harnessed for energy.</p>
          <p><strong>Igneous Rocks:</strong> Formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma. Classified into intrusive (cooled below the surface, e.g., granite) and extrusive (cooled at the surface, e.g., basalt) types. They provide insights into Earth's internal processes.</p>
          <p><strong>Sedimentary Rocks:</strong> Created by the accumulation, compression, and cementation of sediments (fragments of older rocks, minerals, and organic material). They preserve clues about Earth's past environments, fossils, and changing landscapes. Examples include limestone (formed from marine shells), sandstone, and shale.</p>
          <p><strong>Metamorphic Rocks:</strong> Arise from the alteration of existing rocks due to heat and pressure, often deep within Earth's crust. Original minerals recrystallize into new forms, creating a range of textures. Examples include marble (from limestone) and slate (from shale). Metamorphism reveals the tectonic forces shaping the planet.</p>

         <h1>Minerology</h1>
         <h3>Gemstone</h3>
             <p>Gemstones are naturally occurring minerals that have been cut and polished for use in jewelry and other decorative objects. They are prized for their beauty, rarity, and durability. Some of the most popular gemstones include diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and amethysts, but there are many other gemstones with their unique colors, characteristics, and properties.</p>
             <p>Gemstones have been used for thousands of years for their beauty and perceived healing properties. Different cultures and traditions have associated different meanings and uses with various gemstones. For example, ancient Egyptians believed that emeralds symbolized fertility and rebirth, while ancient Greeks believed that amethysts could protect them from drunkenness. Today, gemstones are still highly valued and are used in a variety of ways, such as in jewelry, in alternative healing practices, and in the manufacturing of high-tech equipment.</p>
             <h3>Precious gemstone</h3>
             <p>Rwanda is not known for producing precious gemstones on a large scale. However, there have been some small-scale discoveries of precious gemstones in the country, particularly in the western region.</p>
             <p>One precious gemstone found in Rwanda is sapphire. The sapphires found in Rwanda are typically blue and are mainly mined in the Gatumba area in the northern part of the country. These sapphires are known for their high quality and have been gaining recognition in the global gemstone market.</p>

        <h1>Evolution</h1>
        <h3>Animal evolution</h3>
        <p>Animal evolution refers to the process by which living organisms that belong to the animal kingdom have changed over time through successive generations. Evolutionary changes can result from various mechanisms, such as genetic mutations, natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and other factors.</p>
        <p>There have been several different periods of evolution throughout the history of life on Earth. Here are some of the major periods of evolution:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-Cambrian Era (4.6 billion years ago to 541 million years ago):</strong> This period covers most of the Earth's history, and it saw the emergence of the first prokaryotic organisms, followed by the evolution of eukaryotic cells and multicellular life.</li>
                <li><strong>Paleozoic Era (541 million years ago to 252 million years ago):</strong> This era saw the Cambrian explosion, the rapid diversification of animal life, and the emergence of many new body plans and adaptations. The Paleozoic Era also saw the evolution of plants, the colonization of land by vertebrates, and the development of amphibians and reptiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesozoic Era (252 million years ago to 66 million years ago):</strong> The Mesozoic Era saw the evolution of dinosaurs, birds, and many other reptilian and mammalian groups. This era also saw the emergence of flowering plants, which became dominant on land.</li>
                <li><strong>Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to present):</strong> This era saw the diversification of mammals, the emergence of primates, and the evolution of humans. The Cenozoic Era also saw the evolution of birds and the continued diversification of flowering plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Paleogene Period (66 million years ago to 23 million years ago):</strong> This period saw the recovery and diversification of life after the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. Mammals, including primates, underwent significant evolutionary diversification during this period.</li>
                <li><strong>Neogene Period (23 million years ago to 2.6 million years ago):</strong> The Neogene period saw the emergence of many modern groups of mammals, including apes, elephants, and cats. The climate also underwent significant cooling, leading to the evolution of grasslands and the diversification of grazing animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Quaternary Period (2.6 million years ago to present):</strong> The Quaternary period saw the emergence and diversification of hominins, including the evolution of modern humans. It also saw the evolution and extinction of many large mammals, such as mammoths and saber-toothed cats, and the emergence of modern ecosystems.</li>

        <p>Overall, the history of life on Earth has been characterized by a series of evolutionary changes that have resulted in an enormous diversity of organisms and ecological niches.</p>
    <h3>Human evolution</h3>
    <p>Human evolution refers to the evolutionary process by which modern humans (Homo sapiens) and their ancestral hominid species have emerged over time. The evolution of humans is a complex and ongoing process that has taken place over millions of years, and it involves various hominid species and their adaptations to changing environmental conditions. Here are some of the major stages of human evolution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Australopithecus:</strong> This genus includes several species of bipedal hominids that lived between 4.2 and 2.9 million years ago. They had smaller brains than modern humans but were the first hominids to walk upright on two legs.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo habilis:</strong> This species lived about 2.8 million years ago and is believed to have been the first hominid to use stone tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo erectus:</strong> This species lived between 2 million and 100,000 years ago and had a larger brain than earlier hominids. They were the first hominids to leave Africa and colonize other parts of the world.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo neanderthalensis:</strong> This species lived between 400,000 and 40,000 years ago and had a similar brain size to modern humans. They were adapted to living in cold environments and had a robust build.</li>
        <li><strong>Homo sapiens:</strong> This is the species to which modern humans belong. They emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago and spread to other parts of the world, gradually replacing other hominid species. They are characterized by their larger brain size, advanced culture, and complex social organization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, the evolution of humans is a complex and ongoing process that involves the development of various adaptations, including the use of tools, the evolution of larger brains, and the emergence of advanced social behaviors. The study of human evolution helps us understand our origins and how we have become the species that we are today.</p>

<p>The museum exhibits taxidermied animals found in Akagera National Park for display and further identification of the wildlife. Taxidermy has been practiced for centuries, and it is used for a variety of purposes, including scientific study, hunting trophies, and museum displays. The process of taxidermy typically involves removing the skin from the animal, cleaning and preserving it, and then stuffing it with materials such as cotton or foam. The skin is then mounted on a form or mannequin, and the final result is a lifelike representation of the animal that can be displayed or studied.</p>
